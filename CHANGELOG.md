# Changelog
All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](http://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/).

This project is versioned based upon the version of [nxgipd](https://github.com/tjko/nxgipd). The versioning `X.Y.Z` of the stable release of this add-on will track that of nxgipd. If there are new releases without upgrades to the nxgipd2mqtt version (i.e., changes to the add-on that occur between releases of nxgipd2mqtt), an additional number will be added to indicate this (`X.Y.Z.A`, where `A` indicates a new versioned release).


## [0.1.0](https://github.com/orjvr/hassio-nxgipd2mqtt/releases/tag/v0.1.0) - 2020-06-16
### Changed
Version 0.1.0 is the first ALPHA release of the add-on. The repository actually establishes two add-ons:
- `nxgipd2mqtt` add-on, which will use the beta 1.1.0 version of the `nxgipd` library and will update as new versions of that library are released
